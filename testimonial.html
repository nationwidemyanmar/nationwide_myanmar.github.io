              I'm Khant Min Thuta. I started learning English Language at Nationwide International Academy when I was four and a half years old. Teachers are good at teaching and pay attention to the students. I passed Canbridge Starters with full shields in 2017 and Movers with full shields in 2019 because my teachers taught me well. I've got many experiences in lessons and other activities, too. I really enjoy doing Art & Craft Projects with my friends. There is a library at school and it is my favourite place because I can read many different types of books during break time. Now, I'm learning Cambridge Key For School Online Course and I will try my best to get distinction in Key Exam. I want to say "Thank You" to all my teachers and I'm very happy to study at Nationwide International Academy.

              <br>
              I'm currently learning Cambridge PET here. My English Language Skills used to be very poor before I joined Nationwide. Throughout the years, I can see myself improving at a rate. The teachers are very professional and good at teaching. They train us to become a better self and be independent learner. I have successfully completed Cambridge Flyers Exam with full shields and "Pass at Grade-A" in Cambridge KET Exam.
              <br>
              I enjoy attending classes and doing a variety of activities, assignments and projects. The library is my favourite corner because I can read different types of books during the break time.
              <br>
              I want to say "Thank You Very Much" to all my teachers and I will try my best to get distinction (Grade-A) in Cambridge PET exam. Nationwide International Academy is the best school that I've attended. If you don't believe me, you can try to study here and see for yourself.

I started as a beginner and I'm currently studying IELTS exam preparation course here. From the time of learning English at Nationwide, I've had a lot of professional and selfless guidance from the teachers and met plenty of friendly classmates. Throughout the years, I can see myself improving gradually from the consistent teaching and care of it. I enjoyed attending the classes from the start as they have activities for the students to communication in a fun environment. Overall, Nationwide International Academy has the best quality you can expect for your children or yourself to improve English Language skills.

              Hello! I am Hnin Ei Phyu and I have successfully completed Professional English Course-Intermediate Level with credit from Nationwide International Academy. I used to have poor English and I didn't have confidence in using English language before I studied at Nationwide. Our Teacher is Tr.Thwe Thwe Htway and she is very kind, friendly and patient. We have done so many activities and presentations in out study time. That's why I have improved my English language skills. Now, I'm ready to attend IELTS Foundation Course and I am definitely sure that I will achieve great band scores in IELTS exam.
