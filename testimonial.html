              I'm Khant Min Thuta. I started learning English Language at Nationwide International Academy when I was four and a half years old. Teachers are good at teaching and pay attention to the students. I passed Canbridge Starters with full shields in 2017 and Movers with full shields in 2019 because my teachers taught me well. I've got many experiences in lessons and other activities, too. I really enjoy doing Art & Craft Projects with my friends. There is a library at school and it is my favourite place because I can read many different types of books during break time. Now, I'm learning Cambridge Key For School Online Course and I will try my best to get distinction in Key Exam. I want to say "Thank You" to all my teachers and I'm very happy to study at Nationwide International Academy.

              I have learnt English at Nationwide International Academy since I was in middle school. Nationwide International Academy has taught me how to give presentation properly, how to prepare for IELTS using essential tips and more. I didn't face any difficulties in English Subject at school and at the university as well. I used to work as an intern at an NGO after my first degree, and I had to communicate with international employees. They even praise me regarding my pronunciation that makes me surprised. And I didn't find any difficulties while working with them. Moreover, I was also involved in a project for Tourism Development in Kawthaung in which I had to assit an International English teacher in her ESL training. What I have realized is that Nationwide International Academy has promoted my level of confidence in communicating with foreigners, and has encouraged my writing skill for assignments at the university.

During the whole academic years, all of the teachers, especially Tr.Thwe taught me very kindly and warmly. I have also improved in all the English 4 skills as well as some soft skills because of group activities in class. It was comfortable and fun, learning with the teachers and friends both in peron classes and online classes. Now, I am chosen as one of the scholars to join Asian Nursing Scholarship Program in Singapore. I am very grateful to all my teachers because I would not become who I am now without their guidance and support.
